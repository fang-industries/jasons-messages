        I’m sorry, can you just hear me out; if that’s okay?

        If it sounds like I’m rambling, feel free to cut me off.

        You know I wouldn’t do that - even if you were; but I’ll listen

        I know we broke up months ago, we’ve been through things..

        You’ve even stated that it’s best we aren’t friends either, but want to
        be friends.

        I’ve tried and tried to forget you like you asked, sometimes I do, then,
        sometimes you take over my mind for days, weeks.
      </Message>

        The one thing that’s taken up my mind the most is when you asked me
        “What even is it about me?”. At the time, I didn’t truly didn’t know how
        to answer that question. I didn’t know how to put my feelings into words
        properly.

        But, now I do. You treated me like no one ever has, we had a connection
        that seemed surreal, the way we understood each other was like we were
        made for each other. The person you are, the person you were. You were
        amazing. How can someone not love and cherish someone like you? You
        never had the right mental state yet you always put others above
        yourself.

        Thank you. Unfortunately, I think this conversation should end.
      </Message>
      <Message alignment="right">
        Why? Why do you always fucking run away from your feelings? Please, for
        once. Just face your fears and problems. Tell me how you feel about
        this. I know I asked you to listen and know I said you can cut me off
        whenever but please for once.
      </Message>
      <Message alignment="left"> Fine. </Message>
      <Message alignment="left">
        Truth is, I don’t think I deserve to be with you. I’ve lied to you, I’ve
        hurt you, left you, made promises and never kept them. Why do you keep
        coming back to me? I always leave but you always end up forgiving me. I
        don’t want to seem like I’m taking advantage of you. I’m never in the
        right mental state when we meet, yet you always know how to deal with
        it. I’ve done so much to you, put so much on you and hurt you. I can
        never forgive myself for that and I’ll never understand how you can
        forgive me.
